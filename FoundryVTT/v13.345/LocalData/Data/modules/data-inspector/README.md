Simple inspection tool for actor and item data.

The dialog has 5 modes:

- **Roll Data**... for inspecting data accessible by formulas or anything else fed to _Roll_.
- **Derived Data**... which is the raw actor/item data as the system, macros and modules see it.
- **Source Data**... the permanently stored data, mostly useful for system and module development, or anything that interacts with the permanently stored data.
- **Override Data**... data overrides to source actor in unlinked tokens.
- **Flags**... flag data.

## API

Simple API is exposed to give access to the inspector even in cases where sheets are nonfunctional, or for any other need where the sheet is undesirable or not easily accessible.

```js
const di = game.modules.get('data-inspector')
di.api.inspect(item) // Inspect Item document
di.api.inspect(actor) // Inspect Actor document
```

For example, this allows following in debug console:

```js
game.modules.get('data-inspector').api.inspect(_token.actor)
```

### Custom non-document inspection app handler

```js
Hooks.once('data-inspector.appHandler', (handler) => {
	// App with arbitrary object
	Hooks.on('renderMyApp', (app) => handler(app, (app) => {
		const myThing = app.myObject;
		return {
			object: myThing,
			title: () => myThing.name,
			document: myThing.parent
		}
	}));

	// App with a document or document-like object can return the document-like thing directly.
	Hooks.on('renderMyOtherApp', app => handler(app, (app) => app.object));
});
```

The handler function takes application and object fetcher function as parameters. The object fetcher receives the app as is sole parameter. The object retriever function is only needed if the object is not found via app.document or app.object.

### Custom non-document object inspection

```js
const myObj = parentItemOrSomething.system.somewhere.there;
game.modules.get("data-inspector").api.inspect({
	object: myObj,
	name: () => myObj.name,
	document: parentItemOrSomething
})
```

This requires the extra bits because it can not make many assumptions about non-documents.

## Flaws

- This does not hide secret data.

## Attribution

If you use any of the code in this project, I would appreciate I or the project was credited for inspiration or whatever where appropriate. Or just drop a line about using my code. I do not mind not having this, but it's just nice knowing something has come out of my efforts.
