## Features
### Minimize button (Default: On)
Adds a minimize button that does the same as double-clicking the header

### Organized Minimize (Default: On - Top with Bar)
Allows minimizing windows into a horizontal taskbar. Possible options are:
* **Top**: Minimizes all windows on an invisible horizontal taskbar at the top of the screen below scenes
* **Bottom**: Minimizes all windows on an invisible horizontal taskbar located at the bottom of the screen
* **Top with Bar (Default)**: Minimize all windows inside a bar at the top in which minimized windows will be locked
* **Bottom with Bar**: Minimize all windows inside a bar at the bottom in which minimized windows will be locked
* **Top Taskbar**: All open windows (within supported) are shown on a dedicated space on top of the canvas.
* **Bottom Taskbar**: All open windows (within supported) are shown on a dedicated space bottom of the canvas.
* **Disabled**: Default behavior in Foundry. Minimizes wherever the window was originally.

### Pinned Button (Default: On)
* Adds a pin button on window controls, to prevent them from being closed while pinned.
* Pressing `ESC` will close all windows except Pinned windows. Double tapping `ESC` will minimize them instead (Configurable)
* This is useful for very important sheets that we never want to lose, and find them quickly.

### Remember Pinned Windows (Default: Off)
* Setting `Remember Pinned Windows` will restore pinned windows across sessions, so they will open up again automatically next time.

### Minimize everything when clicking outside a Window (Default: Off)
* Allows quick cleanup of your screen when clicking on the board, without closing anything (except Config and Dialogs)

### Maximize Button (Default: Off)
Adds a maximize button that will expand resizable windows to the maximum available size. Can be restored with the same button.
