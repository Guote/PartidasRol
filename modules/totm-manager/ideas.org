* UI Improvements

** Tabs
Probably the single most important improvement to do sooner rather than later is adding additional tabs to the manager window interface.

- Images: current interface
- Tiles: tile configuration; changes here would affect buttons (how many, names) for tiles in the Image tab
   + Number of tiles (default is three)
   + Tile names (default is speaker1, speaker2, scene)
   + Opacity? 
   + ???


It would be nice to be able to set different glow effects and do things like alter lighting colors or effects from the manager. But where to put such options?

Another issue is that things like glow effects are image specific not tile specific. 

I could potentially create a third tab, call it "Effects". What would go in this tab?
